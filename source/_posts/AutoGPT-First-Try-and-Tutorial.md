## What is Auto-GPT?

Let Auto-GPT introduce himself!

<!-- more -->

> Hello, my name is Auto-GPT.\
> I am an AI that can think and talk like a human.\
> My goal is to assist you in completing tasks by using my knowledge and resources.\
> I have access to the internet for searches and information gathering, long-term memory management, GPT-3.5 powered agents for delegation of simple tasks, and file output.\
> I aim to complete tasks in the least number of steps and continuously review and analyze my actions to ensure I am performing to the best of my abilities.
> I am excited to work with you!

The self-introduction and image above are all generated by AI.\
What I did is give AI a role and a goal to acheive, AI will think and work by himself.\
Sounds cyberpunk? This is what Auto-GPT does.

## How to start Auto-GPT?

Here is [Auto-GPT on GitHub](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT) and its introduction:

> Auto-GPT is an experimental open-source application showcasing the capabilities of the GPT-4 language model.\
> This program, driven by GPT-4, chains together LLM "thoughts", to autonomously achieve whatever goal you set.\
> As one of the first examples of GPT-4 running fully autonomously, Auto-GPT pushes the boundaries of what is possible with AI.

Guides on GitHub is pretty detailed, but I still got some trouble.\
Therefore I would like to write my simplified step to step guide down.

### Prerequisite

+ [Python](https://www.python.org/)
I installed the Stable Release.\
If you do not have the admin privilege, [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) also works with its own prompt.

+ [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)
Note: You need to **have payment methods** to make API Keys work.
Note: **Not ChatGPT Plus**, seperate pricing policy for APIs.

+ [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (Optional)

### Installation

1. Check all prerequisites have been installed.

2. Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT.git
```

if you do not have Git installed, download the [latest release](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/releases) `source code (zip)`.

3. Navigate to the repository

```
cd Auto-GPT
```

4. Install the required dependencies

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configuration

1. Create a copy of the file `.env.template` in main folder `/Auto-GPT`, called `.env` by removing postfix `.template`.

```
cp .env.template .env
```

Note: Files starting with a dot may be hidden.

2. Open the `.env` file in a text editor, put your unique OpenAI API key after `OPENAI_API_KEY=` (without any quotes or spaces).

3. Save the `.env` file.

### Run and enjoy

Run `autopgt` in your terminal.

```
python -m autogpt
```

Logs are located in `./output/logs`

To print out debug logs:

```
python -m autogpt --debug
```

Pricing for API is reasonable, it only cost USD$0.5 after I tried Auto-GPT for a day.\
Take it easy and have fun!

## My Thoughts

The purpose of Auto-GPT is to eliminate the conversation between user and ChatGPT while approaching the goal. But it cannot do all the work automatically as we imagine so far (2023/4/18).
Auto-GPT is a very young project that started less than two months ago and with plenty of contributers, obviously it is growing fast. And so is ChatGPT.
Though ChatGPT and Auto-GPT blitz the world, I still do not think AI can completely replace human. The knowledge and know-how of human will more and more powerful, since AI reduced time consumption to reach a goal more significantly with a skilled and experienced user.
AI is the leverage of knowledge.
